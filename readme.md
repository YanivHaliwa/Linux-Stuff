# System Management and Utilities Linux

Welcome to my collection of simple yet powerful Linux tools! These are just everyday scripts and commands I've put together to make life easier when working with Linux. Whether you're managing your system, handling files, or doing some network stuff, you'll find something here to save you time and effort.

Think of these as your handy toolbox for common Linux tasks. They're not fancy – just practical. I use these regularly to simplify my workflow, and I hope they'll do the same for you.

The files linux_packs_needed.txt and pip_needed.txt contain lists of pip or apt packages needed for some files to work.
